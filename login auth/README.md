--> This is my 3/4 project that i got in my internship with Oasis Infobyte.

--> Here i made a simple login authentication system using simple javascript, css and mongodb database for storing the user data.

--> I used AuthO for password encription. Express framework for backend things.

--> Integrated my prior made countdown page here as a homepage or landing page.

-->we can start the server by simply run the command nodemon src/index.js in the login auth folder.
